## RDP Manager
This is just a simple app to manage a small set of Remote Desktop Session files(.rdp files).
The files will be stored in /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Desktop/rdp.

I wrote this simple tool out of a hatred of using the "Official" remote desktop client, as
it is unbearable to manage multiple sessions with it.

This program by default launches the rdp files using the open command.  You should make sure that
your rdp files are associated to be opened with the the official Microsoft Remote Desktop client.

Created in 1 day from scratch during a hackathon.
